This is a CVS space for the Inspire project.  It contains
Inspire-specific code.  For generic Invenio CVS code, please see 
the 'cds-invenio' CVS project.

The goal of this repository is to install the Inspire instance of Invenio in the following way:

  $ cd cds-invenio
  $ make install
  $ cd ../inspire
  $ make install

so that this repository can overwrite or supply additional files to the standard Invenio codebase.
