A summary of a rough roadmap for the first 6mos-year of the inspire
project, as envisioned by Tim Smith, Annette Holtkamp, Salvatore Mele, and
Travis Brooks at SLAC on 5/12/2007 (As interpreted and added to by TB):

0: Set up mailing lists (at SLAC, this list, investigate archive
accessibility..) and wiki (at CERN? Salvatore? Tibor?) that hsould hose
this document and many others

1: Compare internal record structure of SPIRES and Invenio records for
bibliographic items.

* Leads on this are almost certainly Tibor and Mike.  
* Consider "external" files like Jobs and Inst which are needed for auth. control, but might not migrate...
* Work starts now, possible face to face in early July.
** Back and forth twisting Invenio to store our datastructures
* Note major decision point early on: If invenio cannot store SPIRES records, we must consider other platforms


1.5 Test loading of large chunk (.5MRecs) to test scalability.  Not to be
  mistaken for any sort of test/demonstration  system.  Requires existence
  of at least 1 new Invenio instance ready to store data.  One instance
  already available at SLAC, and this might be most convenient...


* Consider at this point the multiple mirror/master architecture (possibly
* just 2 test sites..)
* Purpose for this is in case Invenio modifications to accomodate SPIRES
  records do not scale appropriately.  Again this is a major decision
  point regarding the appropriateness of Invenio as the underlying system.


2 Define desired inputs from repositories (journals/arXiv..) and determine
influence on data structures  Leads (Annette/Travis? + Invenio person?)


3. Possible 1-day workshop to agree on appropriateness of records.  (part
   of step 1)

4. Can the SPIRES (fussy) search syntax be reproduced by Invenio.
   
* Certainly not completely, however, the most used parts might be
  acceptably translated to invenio search.
* This is neccessary for branding purposes to make users confortable with
  new system (choice will be offered) 
** Also note that survey results show that comments about SPIRES syntax
  were 70% negative and 40% positive (yes, some were both)


5. Enrichment scripts.  SPIRES COllaboration currently has many (separate)
   scripts for enriching data, both fully automatic, and manually
   assisted.  Both the functionality and the ease of user interface (in
   manual cases) should be reproduced in Invenio.  

* Manual (manual assisted) scripts must function well or data quality will
  suffer immediately!
* Catalog of existing scripts (perl and SPIRES protocol) and functionality
** May be useful for SPIRES groups to consolidate scripts and especially
  SPIRES interfaces
** Should consider whether SPIRES->Perl is worthwhile intermediate step
  ,since SPIRES API exists in perl.
* Perl->Python translation (SPIRES->Invenio API)  (or consider Perl
  Invenio API?)  (Possible MC work)
* SPIRES Protocol -> Python is only possible by a few cognoscenti...
* CDS scripts must go through similar process


6. Catalog and compare output formats from SPIRES and CDS.  Must make
   invenio reproduce SPIRES output formats.  Use weblogs to determine
   heavily used formats.  
* Here no translation is possible, must go SPIRES->functionality-> Invenio
